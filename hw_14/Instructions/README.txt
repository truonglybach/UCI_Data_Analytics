There are several limitations that should be noted before querying data and they are as follows:
  - the dates are limited in range, as you can only query between 1/1/2010 and 1/13/2010
  - you must follow the specific formatting as given in the placeholders or else your query will not be recognized
  - the data is mostly representative of UFO sites in the US with very few in Canada
  - the code was designed to work with only the set features; them being, 'datetime', 'city', 'state', etc.
