# Excel 2016

In this assignment, I utilized MS Excel to create a report on Kickstarter projects and derive several insights from the data.
My file showcases my usage of pivot tables, stacked column pivot charts, conditional formatting, and several other tools that are provided by the software.
Please refer to the .docx file for a more thorough analysis.

Please also note that the file has instances where the perspective switches from first-person and third-person. While writing this report, I imagined myself as the lead analyst that was representing a team of data analysts; whom of which where tasked with reporting their findings to an executive officer.

I hope that this information provides more insight over my approach.
